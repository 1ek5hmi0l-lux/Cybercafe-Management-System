# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a simple, command-line based management system for a small cybercafe. The system should allow the cybercafe administrator to manage customer information, track computer usage, and calculate billing. This addresses the need for a basic, low-overhead digital solution to replace manual record-keeping.

## Scope of the Project

The project will focus on core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customer and computer records. It will also include a utility for calculating session costs based on time. The data will be stored in simple CSV files, making the application portable and easy to manage without requiring a database server.

## Target Users

The primary target user for this application is the administrator or owner of a small cybercafe who needs a straightforward tool to manage their daily operations.

## High-level Features

*   **Customer Data Management:** A module to handle all operations related to customer information.
*   **Computer Data Management:** A module to handle all operations related to the cafe's computers.
*   **Time-based Billing:** A function to calculate usage costs based on the duration of a session.
*   **File-based Storage:** All data is stored locally in CSV files for simplicity and portability.
